# HR Analytics Dashboard using SQL and Power BI

## Project Overview  
This project is a practice in data analysis using **SQL Server** and **Power BI**, based on an HR dataset with 2,845 rows and 26 columns. It focuses on understanding employee demographics, training effectiveness, performance, and resignation risk.

## Tools Used  
- **SQL Server** – For data cleaning, transformation, and analysis using SQL Views  
- **Power BI** – For building interactive dashboards connected to SQL views

## Dataset  
- **Source**: Kaggle HR Dataset  
- **Size**: 2,845 rows × 26 columns  
- **Content**: Includes employee demographics, engagement, satisfaction, performance scores, and training data

## SQL Views Created  
- `training`: Calculates average training duration, cost, and success rate  
- `EmployeePerformance`: Aggregates performance, engagement, and satisfaction by employee type  
- `summary`: Adds age categorization and resignation risk classification

## Dashboard Sections  
- **Training**: Compares training programs by type, cost, duration, and outcome  
- **Performance**: Analyzes performance and well-being metrics by employment type  
- **Summary**: Shows workforce composition and resignation risk by age, gender, and division

## Key Insights  
- Internal training tends to be more cost-efficient with comparable success rates  
- Majority of employees fall under the "Medium Risk" resignation category  
- Part-time employees show better work-life balance  
- A large portion of the workforce is nearing retirement age

## Learning Outcomes  
- Developed SQL queries to clean, group, and summarize HR data  
- Built insightful Power BI dashboards using SQL views as data sources  
- Strengthened skills in data storytelling and dashboard design for HR data
